Hi, I'm David!

I'm software engineer living in 🇩🇪 Germany, originally from 🇮🇹 Italy.
I'm currently working at [Checkmk](https://checkmk.com/).

I have a wide range of interests, though none of them have gotten the deep dive I wish they would.
Aside from programming 💻, I enjoy reading 📚, running 🏃, swimming 🏊, trying new foods and restaurants 🍴, and sipping tea 🍵 and coffee ☕.
Oh, and I have a bit of a strange passion for knots 🔗.

I really like to meet new people and learn about their lives, so feel free to reach out to me if you want to chat!
I prefer emails ✉️.
